𝙈𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙨𝙞𝙨 : Leak Detection in Water Supply Networks Using IoT Technologies and Machine Learning

Leak detection in water supply networks using IoT technologies has several significant impacts and benefits, both economically and environmentally. Timely detection of leaks can prevent substantial water or gas losses, reducing utility costs for water providers and, consequently, for consumers. Additionally, prompt response to leaks can prevent costly infrastructure damage and the need for emergency repairs. Leak detection contributes to the conservation of valuable resources such as water, which is essential for industries and households. Protecting water resources helps sustain aquatic ecosystems and reduces the need for energy-intensive water treatment processes. Similar benefits are observed in infrastructure, as early leak detection can prevent pipeline damage, whose repair or replacement can be costly. Protecting critical infrastructure ensures the reliability of essential services for end-users.

Leak detection in water supply networks using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is an efficient way to monitor and identify water or gas leaks in pipelines. IoT solutions provide real-time data and alerts, enabling rapid response and mitigation of potential damage or losses. Such systems incorporate a wide range of technologies, including:

Sensor Networks: These sensors can include various types, such as acoustic sensors, pressure sensors, flow sensors, or even cameras for visual inspection.
Data Collection: Sensors continuously collect data related to the pipeline's condition, such as pressure, flow rate, temperature, and any abnormal sounds. This data is typically transmitted to a central IoT platform for processing and analysis.
Data Analysis: Algorithms process incoming data in real time. Machine learning-based algorithms can detect anomalies or patterns indicative of leaks. Machine learning models can be trained to differentiate between normal operating conditions and potential leaks based on historical data and sensor measurements.
Goals of this thesis include:

A study and critical review of the existing literature and analysis of related systems' data.
The development of a machine learning model for detecting malfunctions in water supply/irrigation networks.
The study and evaluation of various relevant algorithms to select the optimal solution. Training data will be based on open databases. The predictive engine, based on the final selected model, will be deployable and operable either in a Kubernetes environment or in AWS cloud infrastructure.

Tools to be used: Python, Bash scripting, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS.
